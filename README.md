# javascript-challenge

This is the homework assignment for the JHU Data Analytics Bootcamp week 14.  We studied javascript.  We were given a data file of UFO sightings and an html document.  I created a javascript file that loaded the UFO sighting data onto the webpage.  Then the used has the option to filter the data by date.  Subsequent filters will result in the table being updated with the newly filtered data.
